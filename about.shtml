                        <p>The successful and ground-breaking show was originally created and launched in London by Michael and Wes Johnson-Ellis from the UK, active LGBTQ+ content creators and campaigners for the community. They are also Dads to their children, Talulah (6) and Duke (3) born via gestational surrogacy. They know only all too well how difficult it can be navigating all the options and pathways for LGBTQ+ people, so they set out to change this. They also wanted to create an education-first event, providing a safe space for all the attendees to network and discuss the varied options available.</p>
                        <p>The first London show took place in September 2021 with wonderful success. Michael and Wes and the wider team are all passionate about raising awareness and driving change, and this is why they wanted to keep bring the show back every year.</p>

                        <p>‘To provide a safe space for the entire community to seek advice, support and to understand the options ahead of their family-building journey’.</p>
                        <p> An event designed for everyone, and not just for men. A show that educates in a safe and secure space with only the leading professionals, community members and allies. Our exclusive and impressive Modern Family Show Main Stage will deliver educational informal sessions from some of the leading experts and familiar faces, whilst our seminar rooms provide structured presentations, key notes and guides specialising in Fertility, Adoption, Fostering, Donation services, and Fertility Preservation guidance.</p>
                        <p>The Modern Family Show has assembled a collection of social media parenting inﬂuencers (our advocates) to act as the voice for their chosen family group and wider parenting community as part of the #AskMe programme. Our advocates are all parents or parents to be, and whether that’s as a result of Fostering, Adoption, Trans-Parents, Co-parenting, Surrogacy or Sperm/Egg donation, they'll be there to answer any questions you may have with advice from their own lived experiences.</p>
