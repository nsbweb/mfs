TTC IVF/IUI</h6>
                <p>We are Lucy and Amy! Our story started with medicated IUI’s which resulted in negative pregnancy tests. After 3 unsuccessful rounds we moved onto IVF (ICSI). Surgeries, delays, cancelled cycles, many tears, heartbreak and three miscarriages later - a frozen embryo transfer gave us our rainbow baby, Nathaniel. That little rainbow baby is now a 2-year-old and as cliche as it sounds, he really was worth the wait.</p>
                <p>We were very lucky to have two embryos still frozen after Nathaniel’s cycle and we recently welcomed our beautiful daughter Tahlia into our family.</p>
                <p>We have shared our experience of trying to conceive as a same sex couple on our Instagram, Our Big Gay Journey - from how we chose our sperm donor to our life now, with 2 little ones. The ultimate goal of our account is to be a visible two Mum family; to normalise same sex families and help to make positive changes for the community.</p>
                <p>Sadly, we can&#39;t make it to the show this year, but you can follow us on our Instagram @ourbiggayjourney.</p>
